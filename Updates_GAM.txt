 - The project is based on xfemm and its development is carried out to improve the
   plot functionalities. It was based on the version from soundforge with a few updates
   from the github version.
   soundforge: https://sourceforge.net/projects/xfemm/
   github: https://github.com/REOptimize-Systems/xfemm

 - extent_mfemm() was updated to evaluate arc segments when defining problem extents.

 - fpproc() was modified to include
	. New syntax plotBfield('Parameter', Value), plotHfield('Parameter', Value)
	and plotAfield('Parameter', Value). When [x, y, w, h] is not defined, the
	function extent_mfemm() is used.
	. Plot of the femmProblem is carried out after the results and without Nodes
	  and the Labels. 

	For the methods fpproc.plotBfield and plotHfield:
	. 'Method': 0 for vector field using colored arrows. 
		    1 for density plot.
	. 'Points' determines the number of arrows that will be plotted using method 0.
	. 'Density' determines the density of the interpolation for density plot (method 1).
	. 'ShowFlux' enables the plot of the flux lines, with its number defined by 'FluxLines'.
	. 'PlotCylindrical' uses cylindrical coordinates to define the interpolation region for 
		density plot. For cylindrical coordinates, input parameters are
		[r, theta, r_length, th_width], where:
		- r: initial radius;
		- theta: initial angle;
		- r_length: radial length;
		- th_width]: circunferential width.

	For the methods fpproc.plotAfield:
	. 'Method': 0 for filled contour plot, also defined by variable 'Density'. 
		    1 was not defined.

 - fmesher() is crashing. As an alternative, the mesh is executed using *.exe file:
	. system(['C:\[installed folder]\xfemm_mingw_win64\cfemm\bin\fmesher ' filename]);
